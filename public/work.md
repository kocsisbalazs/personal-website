# Technology entrepreneur, investor, & future forward optimist
I have been working on a series of investments, incubations, and operating companies focused on the technology future.

## Entrepreneurship & running companies.

Started two companies (Mixerlabs - bought by Twitter - and Color Health)

Recently incubated / helped start Braintrust, an AI eval (and more!) company

Was a VP at Twitter (which bought a startup where I was CEO) and worked on AI & mobile at Google

I also wrote the best-selling High Growth Handbook - tactical advice for post-product market fit companies (hiring, product, M&A, sales, HR issues, fundraises etc). You can buy the book on Amazon or read for free online

## AI. I got involved with ML & Deep Learning early.
- Finished the FastAI course.
- Have done several AI projects in the past, see below.
- Practical explanation of AI.

Projects I need help with: Monumental (coming soon!), a chain of new K-12 schools inspired by ancient Greece, two new foundation models I want to exist.
